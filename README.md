Eventify is an event management system built with React/Next.js/Tailwind. It leverages an API created in a group project, which is available here: https://github.com/chvlpont/event

Features
Authentication: Users can register an account and must log in to access the site. The same authentication method used in the group project is utilized.

Event Listing: All events from the database are listed on a dedicated page.

Individual Event View: Users can view detailed information about each event on a separate page.

Event Booking: Users can book a spot for an event if seats are available.

Full Event Indicator: Clearly indicates if an event is fully booked.

Event Cancellation: Users can cancel their registration for an event if they change their mind.

Sorting: Events can be sorted by date and location.

Hide Past Events: Events that have already occurred are automatically hidden from the main event page.

Test: This test suite verifies the presence of specific <div> elements, including "Contact Us", "About", and "FAQ", within the Footer component.
